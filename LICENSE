DON'T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE v6.9

Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a DICK!

✈ Being a DICK includes just copying the original work and changing the name.
✈ Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a DICK.
✈ Modifying the original work to contain harmful content. That would make you a PROPER DICK.
✈ Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong
   makes you a DONKEY DICK. Fix the problem yourself.
✈ If you use code, calling it your own would make you a ROYAL DICK. Alternatively, even just a comment
   giving attribution to where you found the code would be OK.
✈ If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work, 
   share the love. Only a DICK would make loads off this work and not give the original work's 
   creator(s) a bit of credit/support.
